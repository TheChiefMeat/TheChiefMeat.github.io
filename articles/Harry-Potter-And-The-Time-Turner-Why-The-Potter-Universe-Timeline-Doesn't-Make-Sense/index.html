# Harry Potter & The Time Turner - Why The Potter Universe Timeline Doesn't Make Sense

After marathoning through the entire Harry Potter filmography, I inevitably got to Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban. Near the end of the film, Sirius Black is captured by the Ministry Of Magic at Hogwarts, to await his sentence; The kiss of a Dementor.

Upon hearing the news from no other than Dumbledore himself, Hermione and Harry venture back into the recent past to attempt to change not only the fate of Sirius Black, but also that of the Hippogriff Buckbeak.

Prior to these events, Harry, Hermione and Ron had already experienced what appeared to be the work of time-travelling versions of themselves. This interaction poses a few questions. The first question is this:

If Hermione had already seen a prior version of herself go back in time, and attempt to save Sirius, why go back in time herself? (The past Hermiones actions are identical to that of the Hermione that goes back in time - Identical actions = Identical outcome). Surely if this alternative Hermione had succeeded, Current Hermione would need to do nothing, as she'd only have to wait for the other Hermione to save Sirius at the top of the tower. From the current Hermiones perspective, Sirius would simply be reported as missing, the Hippogriff missing, and the tower that housed Sirius Black would be empty.

If this isn't the case, Hermione wouldn't and shouldn't of even of seen the past version of herself (she would of been the first ever version of herself to travel back to that period in time). If this is true, all future Hermiones may need to, and in fact may be fated to follow the same time-travelling path the first Hermione took.

This raises the question: Is Hermione forced to go back through time, to save Sirius? Logically no; We've seen a second Herimone and must assume that her actions are identical to that of the current Hermione. If the actions of each Hermione are different, this would suggest a constantly branching time-line with infinite universes.

The idea that Herminoes actions are not fated pose an even bigger question. If Herminoe, in one timeline, were not be successful in saving Sirius, would Sirius have saved Harry during his fight with Bellatrix Lestrange? It is possible that without Sirius being saved from the top of the tower, Harry Potter may have died in the ministry.

Assuming that this timeline could exist, one could easily assume that the Horcruxes would never have been destroyed, at least those that Harry himself hunted down. Voldemort would have been successful in his attempt to control both Hogwarts and the Ministry.
